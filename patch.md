## Patch: git diff -w -U0

  - The context lines generated by -w and -b options for git diff
    do not match the parent file, instead,
    the whitespace involved matches the 'messy' commit.
    Both git apply and patch do not like this.

  - When they look at the expected context from the patch,
    they think that the context does not match,
    and that the patch therefore cannot be applied.
    Varous 'ignore whitespace', &tc. options do not seem to affect this.

  The Workaround:
  - Get rid of the context lines.
    Generate the patches with git diff -w -U0
    (U for unified diff format, 0 for number of context lines),
    which leaves only the line numbers and replacement line data.
    Since this is a clean patch
    (Applied to the revision that was the parent of the original commit)
    The line numbers are the only thing that patch needs.
    NOTE: git apply still did not like these patches for some reason,
    though patch seems to think they are just mahvelous.

  If you try it:

  This only works if the file that you are applying to
  is the line for line equivalent of the one used as a base for the diff.

  In practice, if you have a series of messy commits {1, 2, 3} on top of a clean base, 0, you need to:
  - Create a new branch, starting at 0.
  - Generate your patch for 1 against 0
  - Apply the patch to your new branch as 1a
  - Generate your patch for 2 against the new, clean commit 1a
  - &tc, as needed
